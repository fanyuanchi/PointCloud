# PC-PS: A Publish/Subscribe System for Streaming Point-Cloud Data with Continuous Range Queries

This repository contains the source code for **PC-PS**, a high-performance publish/subscribe system for processing massive streaming point-cloud data with continuous range (CR) queries. This work was proposed in our paper:

## üîç Overview

PC-PS addresses the challenges of real-time point-cloud data processing in dynamic environments. It features:

- **R-BVH Index**: An incremental spatial index with 2‚Åø-ary tree and Morton encoding.
- **Code Coverage Registration**: A hybrid query insertion algorithm allows CR quey to register in both leaf and non-leaf nodes of R-BVH.
- **Two-Phase Matching**: Efficient data-query matching via `Filter-and-Construct` and `Match-and-Update` stages.
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-core adaptive workload balancing during query registration and data publishing.

## üìä Datasets
We evaluate PC-PS on two real-world datasets: 

- **WHU-TLS** (dense & sparse terrestrial LiDAR, including WHU-TLS-R and WHU-TLS-M): http://3s.whu.edu.cn/ybs/en/benchmark.htm 

- **Paris-Lille-3D** (nD urban street LiDAR): https://npm3d.fr/paris-lille-3d
